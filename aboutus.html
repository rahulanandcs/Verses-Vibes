                    Inspired by the neurodegenerative disease sweeping through society and the neglect to those in senior living facilities, we serve to provide companions and neural stimulus for citizens of the senior living homes. Having a personal connection to the debilitative effect of Alzheimer's disease and the subsequent societal isolation, we strive to prevent the neglect of those with neurodegenerative diseases.
